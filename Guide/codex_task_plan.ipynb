    "# LibertyConnect — Codex Task Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Give Codex a crystal-clear, step-by-step plan to populate the codebase. Each task is atomic, has strict inputs/outputs, files to touch, and *Definition of Done* (DoD). Follow the tasks **in order** to minimize back-and-forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Stacks: Expo (Router, Notifications), Supabase (Postgres + RLS, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions), TanStack Query (with AsyncStorage persist), FlashList. Deep linking via custom scheme + Universal/App Links. Scheduling via Supabase Cron + Scheduled Functions.  \n",
    "> CI/CD & Observability are handled elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0) Ground Rules for Codex\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contract-first**: implement types/interfaces and DB migrations before UI/Edge code.\n",
    "- **Tenant safety**: every query filtered by `org_id`; never select cross-tenant data.\n",
    "- **No secrets in client**: service role keys only in Edge Functions.\n",
    "- **Idempotency**: all Edge Functions must be safe to retry.\n",
    "- **Accessibility**: touch targets ≥44px, labels on tappables; error states present.\n",
    "- **Testing hooks**: keep simple unit seams; DB has pgTAP tests for policies.\n",
    "- **Offline**: wrap app in `PersistQueryClientProvider` and persist via AsyncStorage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Prerequisites (one-time)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Files**: `mobile/src/types/database.types.ts`, `mobile/src/lib/supabase.ts`, `.env`, `supabase/config.toml`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-1.1 Generate Supabase types**\n",
    "  - Run: `supabase gen types typescript --project-id <id> --schema public > mobile/src/types/database.types.ts`\n",
    "  - Create `mobile/src/lib/supabase.ts` exporting a typed `createClient<Database>()`.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: `Database` type compiles; app builds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-1.2 Environment sanity**\n",
    "  - Ensure `.env` and `.env.production` have URLs, anon keys; `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` only on server.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: App boots in dev; functions see env via `Deno.env.get()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Database & Migrations (schema-first)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Files**: `supabase/migrations/030_storage_policies.sql`, `040_search_fts.sql`, `050_rls_policies.sql`, `seed/demo-org-and-users.sql`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-2.1 Storage buckets & RLS**\n",
    "  - Buckets: `events`, `announcements`, `avatars`.\n",
    "  - Path: `bucket/{org_id}/...` and RLS on `storage.objects` granting org members select/insert.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: Upload by member succeeds; cross-org read/write denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-2.2 Full-Text Search**\n",
    "  - Add `tsvector` on Announcements(title+body) & Prayers(body) + GIN indexes.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: `plainto_tsquery('english', 'hope')` returns ranked rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-2.3 Core RLS policies**\n",
    "  - Policies for: organizations, organization_members, announcements, devotionals, prayers, prayer_reactions, events, rsvps, checkins, reports, blocks, device_tokens, notification_preferences.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: Non-members denied; members read; role-gated writes work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-2.4 Seed demo org**\n",
    "  - One org, 3 users (owner, moderator, member) and basic content/events.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: Seed runs; app lists data without auth (guest mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) Scheduled Jobs (Cron + Scheduled Functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Files**: `supabase/migrations/020_cron_reminders.sql`, `supabase/migrations/010_cron_ttls.sql`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-3.1 Event reminder cron**\n",
    "  - Schedule every minute to call `functions/event_reminder_30m` (drift-safe +/- 1m window around T-30).\n",
    "  - **DoD**: Cron visible in Dashboard; function receives payload; logs show sends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-3.2 Housekeeping/TTL cron**\n",
    "  - Hourly TTL sweep for `expires_at`, report age summary.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: Expired items hidden; open report counts emitted to logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) Edge Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "> All functions in `supabase/functions/**/index.ts` with shared helpers in `_shared/*`. Use Deno + `@supabase/supabase-js@2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-4.1 `save_device_token`**\n",
    "  - Upsert `{ user_id, token, platform, last_seen_at }` and respect `disabled_at`.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: Multiple devices per user OK; upsert idempotent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-4.2 `event_reminder_30m`**\n",
    "  - Query RSVPs (`yes`) for events starting in 29–31 min; join tokens + `notification_preferences.events`.\n",
    "  - De-dupe tokens; chunk send to Expo; include deep link `data.url` (`myapp://event/<id>`).\n",
    "  - **DoD**: Test log shows N pushes; empty set handled gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-4.3 `push_receipts`**\n",
    "  - Poll Expo receipts; prune tokens with `DeviceNotRegistered` by setting `disabled_at`.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: Tokens marked disabled when receipts error; unaffected tokens untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-4.4 `notification_prefs_upsert`**\n",
    "  - Save per-category toggles (`events, announcements, devotionals, prayer_replies`) per org.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: Round-trip from app settings works; defaults created on first save.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-4.5 `report_action`**\n",
    "  - Admin-only: action/dismiss reports, hide/unhide target, audit to `admin_actions`.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: Non-admin forbidden; actions recorded atomically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-4.6 `impersonate`**\n",
    "  - Admin-only: generate Magic Link for target user; return `action_link` JSON; audit action.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: Link opens session as target in incognito; audit row created.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-4.7 `search`**\n",
    "  - Expose FTS query endpoint for announcements/prayers with `q`, `org_id`, pagination.\n",

    "  - **DoD**: Cold/warm app opens to the right screen from a push.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-5.3 Push registration**\n",
    "  - Request permission contextually; register with Edge `save_device_token`.\n",

    "## 6) Mobile App — Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Announcements & Devotionals**\n",
    "- **T-6.1 APIs & hooks**\n",
    "  - Implement `features/announcements/api.ts` and hooks for list/read; include time-gating (`published_at/expires_at`).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **T-6.4 Report**\n",
    "  - Modal `app/(modals)/report.tsx` and API to create `reports` rows.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Events**\n",
    "- **T-6.5 Events list/detail**\n",
    "  - Implement `events/api.ts`, `useEvents`, `useEvent`; detail shows cover, time, map/location link.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: Time shown in local TZ; past events indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-6.6 RSVP**\n",
    "  - `useRSVP.ts` upsert own RSVP; UI button reflects `yes|no|maybe`.\n",
    "  - **DoD**: Change is reflected immediately; works offline then syncs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search**\n",
    "- **T-6.7 Search UI**\n",
    "  - `features/search/*` basic search bar; debounce; call `functions/search`.\n",

    "> Use these as the **system prompt** + **file context** when asking Codex to implement code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### P-1: Edge Function boilerplate\n",
    "**System**: “You are writing Supabase Edge Functions in Deno with `@supabase/supabase-js@2`. Functions must be idempotent, typed, and never leak service keys to the client.”  \n",
    "**Context**: `supabase/functions/_shared/{supabase.ts,push.ts,http.ts}` + target `index.ts`  \n",
    "**Ask**: “Implement `<function>` as specified in Task T-4.x. Accept JSON input, validate, perform DB actions, return JSON. Add structured logs.”\n",

    "**Ask**: “Build `report_action` function and the admin queue screen per T-4.5 and T-6.9.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### P-5: Deep Linking + Push\n",
    "**System**: “You integrate Expo Linking and Notifications. Push payloads must include `data.url` which opens the correct screen.”  \n",
